"I want to thank the House Environmental Resources and Energy Committee for hosting this hearing today on climate, energy, and so-called “solutions” like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). It is with great interest that I am following Pennsylvania’s climate and energy debate. My family has deep roots in Pennsylvania. My father’s parents immigrated here from Italy in the early 1900s through Ellis Island and ended up settling in Scranton Pa. My mother’s parents immigrated to the U.S. from Italy and settled in Uniontown PA. My grandfather was a coal miner in Smock PA. I am not a scientist, although I do occasionally play one on TV. My background is in political science, which happens to be an ideal background for examining man-made global warming claims and their socalled “solutions.” It is amazing to me that everyone here believes that you can legislate in Pennsylvania — a better climate by increasing energy costs, harming yourself economically, and turning over more energy decisions to politicians, lobbyists, and activists who are going to join up with other states and try to dictate Pennsylvania energy policy. This is one of the worst things Pennsylvania could possibly get itself embroiled in and yet, many members here today believe they are “saving the planet” by beginning the death of a thousand cuts to the state’s fracking miracle. Pennsylvania should reject these so-called “mandatory market-based programs” that will increase costs, bureaucracy, damage job production and do nothing for the environment. Make no mistake, these climate schemes are nothing more than the regulatory state and its promoters trying to use the “global warming” scare to get legislation passed that would otherwise not stand a chance. The wacky world of climate I want to briefly give an update on the wacky world of climate change and how “the science” has seen changing definitions of climate and solutions. When Al Gore’s film An Inconvenient Truth came out in 2006, the former VP focused on purported science to justify the need for action on climate change. Diminishing polar bear numbers, rising sea levels, global temperatures, and CO2 level increases were cited by Gore as justifications for government action. But the modern climate change activists, however, feel they no longer need to use those typical metrics of so-called evidence to prove global warming. In today’s woke culture, to understand how global warming is faring, one must ditch the hard sciences and examine things like airline turbulence, rape statistics, crime statistics, vehicle theft statistics, train derailments, police shootings, toxic masculinity, white supremacy, and car accidents. All of these are now claimed to be a measure of global warming. Just 15 years ago, “solutions” to global warming included carbon taxes, cap-and-trade schemes, carbon credits, and UN treaties. Today, say the woke climate activists, to solve climate change, Americans must cancel pet ownership, wish death to climate “deniers,” shrink humans, eat insects, end white supremacy, stop having kids and defund the police. The new woke marketing term used today is that the world faces a “climate emergency.” It is based upon implausible extreme climate scenarios that the UN began pushing in recent years. When current reality fails to alarm, they just make scarier and scarier predictions of the future. RGGI is ‘cheap power politics’ It is a shame that the state of Pennsylvania is wading into meaningless climate-inspired regulations. Pennsylvania has been the energy success story of America. This state has led the way for the United States world-leading CO2 reductions. If you really cared about CO2 reductions, you would be embracing your fracking revolution; you would be embracing Pennsylvania’s energy legacy. Even CNN and the Washington Post recognize how important fracking should be to climate activists. CNN correspondent and Washington Post columnist Fareed Zakaria explained in February 2020 why states like Pennsylvania are crucial if you are actually concerned about CO2 emissions. (You should not be concerned, but if you were, fracking is your best ally.) Zakaria noted that the U.S. carbon dioxide emissions fell almost 15 percent between 2005 and 2016 and that “the single largest cause for that” was natural gas replacing coal-fired power, which accounted for 33 percent of the reduction. “The adoption of solar power, by contrast, accounted for just 3%,” Zakaria said. RGGI’s cap and trade carbon taxation scheme is going to raise the cost of energy for Pennsylvania, needlessly stifle fracking jobs, and have no impact not only on the weather or climate but will not lower global CO2 emissions. RGGI and other “solutions” will do nothing more than shoot ourselves in the foot by hampering U.S. domestic energy production. Again, Pennsylvania is the leading light of the world with its fracking revolution. If your state’s climate activists -- who actually believe they have the power to regulate and tax our climate and change it -- get their way and turn Pennsylvania into New York, your residents will suffer and our energy security and our national security will suffer. The real reason RGGI is being pushed is nothing short of a cover for cheap power politics. DEP Secretary Patrick McDonnell recently explained: “One highly anticipated benefit, though, is how this program will elevate and uplift our state’s most distressed communities by investing funding from RGGI proceeds into them.” So when you get down to it, this is not a climate-centered program, it is a political pork spending bill that can be used by politicians to distribute the money as they see fit. Gov. Wolf explained: “Funds brought in through RGGI will allow us to make targeted investments to support workers and communities affected by energy transition, invest in environmental justice, and strengthen Pennsylvania’s clean energy, commercial and industrial sectors.” Think about that. Gov. Wolf is bragging that politicians like himself will get to use funds from this program to “make targeted investments to support workers.” Workers that the RGGI program will put out of work! Politicians can force unnecessary unemployment on Pennsylvanians and then portray themselves as heroes when they offer targeted government funds to “rescue” the same workers from the government’s ill-advised unscientific policies which put these workers on unemployment in the first place. It’s like “rescuing” someone from a sinking ship after you put holes in the boat to ensure it sank. Gov. Wolf was not finished. He recently said: “Participating in RGGI will further our commonwealth’s climate goals, mitigate ongoing damage from climate change and invest in our workforce.” Really? How will the RGGI “mitigate ongoing damage from climate change” when the scheme would not even impact global emissions. To the extent that wealthy developed nations shut down their own domestic energy exploration through efforts like carbon taxes, RGGI, and the Green New Deal, global emissions will invariably rise as energy extraction moves to countries without the high environmental standards we employ in the U.S. So let’s not pretend that this is anything but a bureaucratic power grab. Lobbyists are all in on seeing RGGI implemented in Pennsylvania because it gives them direct leverage on how they can best juice the system. Gov. Wolf’s claim that the RGGI’s emission plan will “mitigate ongoing damage from climate change” is embarrassingly silly and unscientific. But to the media, activists, and many of the professors and members here today, Gov. Wolf’s inane comments somehow resonate with your political views so you give him a pass on his utterly meaningless claims. Back to the 1950s! Do not allow Pennsylvania to fall down the climate rabbit hole. As I detail in my book Green Fraud, USA energy has been booming -- thanks in large part to Pennsylvania! The U.S. has finally transformed from an energy importer to an energy exporter. In 2019, as the shale natural gas fracking boom continued unabated (THANKS PENNSYLVANIA!) BP reported that the U.S. now led the world in both oil and natural gas production growth. We had achieved not only energy independence but dominance, for the first time since 1952 when Harry S. Truman was president.",R
"In some parts of the country, standing up for Israel is controversial, even dangerous. On the campuses of places like Harvard, Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania, anyone who dares to wave an Israeli flag — or, increasingly, wear a kippah in public — is at risk of being assaulted by angry mobs of people with their faces covered. In Los Angeles, a pro-Israel protester was allegedly killed by a pro-Palestinian computer-science professor. (Judge Ryan Wright slashed the prof’s bail from the original $1 million to just $50,000.) Many parents of Jewish students are concerned, and rightly so, about their kids’ safety at these institutions. Even off campus, the streets of New York and many other big blue metropolises seem kind of dangerous for Jews these days. Things are a bit different in my neck of the woods. I live in Knoxville, Tenn., home of the University of Tennessee, where we’ve seen none of this sort of violence. Last week I attended a pro-Israel rally in downtown Knoxville that was peaceful, ecumenical and quite moving. At the center of Knoxville’s booming downtown is Market Square, where the city’s Jewish Alliance set up a table with 239 place settings to commemorate the hostages Hamas terrorists took from Israel. Each chair bore a poster with the name, bio and photo of a hostage. They ranged from babies to older adults. Several hundred people attended. There were speeches by local political figures, all pro-Israel, including Knoxville’s Rep. Tim Burchett. All expressed sympathy for Israel, horror at Hamas’ brutality and support for the hostages. There were backing letters from Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, and Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty. There were prayers by both Jewish and Christian religious leaders. Many attendees bore Israeli and American flags. There were no counterprotesters, and although there was a police presence, it was subdued and not needed. Passersby seemed generally friendly and supportive. When the event ended, people fanned out to have dinner at downtown restaurants, buy ice cream and generally make an evening of it. Of course, not everyone is on the same page, even in a place like Knoxville. As I write this, a group called Palestinian Action and Liberation is planning to pack the next City Council meeting, dressed in black, and demand a statement in support of Gaza and a boycott of doing business with Israel. But the numbers of this group are much smaller, and while they may cause headaches for Knoxville’s Democratic mayor, Indya Kincannon, who they’re criticizing for having recently visited Israel, I doubt she’s losing much sleep.Most important, public order has been maintained. Since the Black Lives Matter riots of the last decade, the Knoxville police and Knox County sheriff have kept order. Protests and rallies are protected; people who try to get away with violence or property destruction are arrested and prosecuted. Likewise, on the University of Tennessee campus, the administration has been strongly supportive of free speech but unwilling to tolerate disruptive, destructive or violent behavior. This shouldn’t even be worth mentioning, but it is. Ever since Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake gave rioters “space” to “destroy” in 2015, many municipal leaders have taken a hands-off attitude toward destructive mobs (at least those mobs aligned with the left, which to be fair is pretty much all of them). This has been bolstered by the criminal-justice “reform” approach of not charging or prosecuting for most crimes even people who are arrested. University administrators have shown a similar unwillingness to enforce basic principles of social order and provide a basic level of security and protection for students and faculty targeted by angry mobs. So it’s actually kind of newsworthy to note not everywhere operates that way. It’s possible for people to engage in free speech without official toleration of violence — in fact, it’s official intolerance of violence that makes free speech for everyone possible. (As Adlai Stevenson once said, a free society is one in which it is safe to be unpopular.) The irony is so many of those people who are supposed to be the curators of our civilization have forgotten this truth — or chosen to disregard it. Also ironic: More people who remember these things are to be found running things in the allegedly intolerant red states than in those jurisdictions that go on and on about their tolerance.",R
"Laura Ingraham sat down with Republican contender Vivek Ramaswamy for an insightful discussion on the evolving dynamics within both the Republican and Democratic parties. Ramaswamy, who is considered a among top three GOP candidates for the 2024 election, shared his perspectives on various issues that could shape the upcoming race. Laura wasted no time delving into the topic of a contingency plan among the Democrats, hinting at a potential shift in strategy. Ramaswamy responded with conviction, expressing his belief that the Democrats would be reluctant to pit President Biden against a candidate like himself in a general election. The sharp contrast in their ideologies and policies would be too apparent for voters to ignore. The discussion then shifted to the Republican Party’s changing landscape and the rise of the America First movement. Ramaswamy asserted that this movement represents the future of the party, with the old guard gradually fading away. He also acknowledged the Democratic Party’s adoption of certain Republican principles on foreign policy, highlighting the need for the Republican Party to stay ahead of the curve. Laura inquired about Ramaswamy’s relationship with former President Donald Trump, to which he replied that they have a friendly rapport, appreciating aspects of both Trump and Ron DeSantis, another prominent contender. However, Ramaswamy expressed his belief that he can uniquely unite the country and bring young voters into the fold. Laura suggested that Ramaswamy and DeSantis should drop out of the race and support Trump, given his overwhelming popularity. Ramaswamy countered by emphasizing the importance of a robust debate within the party to determine the best candidate to carry forward the America First agenda.",R
"Natural experiments are rare in politics, but few are as instructive as the prototype for ObamaCare that Massachusetts set in motion in 2006. The bills for ""universal coverage"" are now coming due, and it appears the state political class is prepared to do lasting damage to one of America's top-flight health-care systems. Last month, Democratic Governor Deval Patrick landed a neutron bomb, proposing hard price controls across almost all Massachusetts health care. State regulators already have the power to cap insurance premiums, which Mr. Patrick is activating. He also filed a bill that would give state regulators the power to review the rates of hospitals, physician groups and some specialty providers. Those that are deemed too high ""shall be presumptively disapproved."" Mr. Patrick ad-libbed that he had ""a whole bunch of pals here who are in the health-care field, and I saw the color drain out of their faces."" Little wonder. The administered prices of Medicare and Medicaid already shift costs to private patients while below-cost reimbursement creates balance-sheet havoc among providers. Now the governor wants to import these distortions to save the state's heavily subsidized insurance program as costs explode. It doesn't even count as an irony that former Governor Mitt Romney (like President Obama) sold this plan as a way to control spending. As with all new entitlements, the rolling cost crisis began almost immediately. For fiscal 2010 taxpayer costs are $47 million over budget, in part due to the recession, and while the $913 million Mr. Patrick requested for 2011 is a 5% increase over 2010, spending has grown on average 6.7% per year. Meanwhile, average Massachusetts insurance premiums are now the highest in the nation. Since 2006, they've climbed at an annual rate of 30% in the individual market. Small business costs have increased by 5.8%. Per capita health spending in Massachusetts is now 27% higher than the national average, and 15% higher even after adjusting for local wages and academic research grants. The growth rate is faster too. Those data come from granular studies about the Massachusetts health markets published recently by the state. Not that anyone on Beacon Hill seems to have to read them, judging by their policy proposals. Besides Mr. Patrick's latest inspiration, last year a blue-ribbon commission endorsed a ""global budget""—i.e., an arbitrary government limit on medical spending, with politics shaping what gets covered and what doesn't. As in Washington, the political class and providers blame insurers, but a better culprit is the state's insurance regulation. Incredibly, the average ""medical loss ratio"" in Massachusetts for individual policies is 112%—that is, insurers pay $1.12 in benefits for every $1 in premiums. This is the direct result of forcing insurers to charge everyone more or less the same rate regardless of age or health status, which makes it rational for people to wait to enroll until they need expensive coverage. It is also the result of the state's decision to merge the individual and small-group insurance markets, which transfers individual costs onto small businesses. Mr. Patrick actually justified his plan by citing small-business costs. Another reason costs are so high is that state regulations have mandated that insurance coverage be far richer than the rest of the country. The average insurance deductible is 28% lower than the U.S. average, and the benefits are more generous with less cost-sharing. Patients are thus insensitive to the cost of care. The insurance industry points the finger back at providers, given that over the entire Massachusetts market they usually spend 88 cents of every premium dollar on claims. But the Bay State medical system isn't wasteful by any of the fashionable measures. The Dartmouth Atlas that measures regional variation in the supposed ""overuse"" of care ranks the state near the U.S. middle. Though some large hospital systems, especially in Boston, have the market power to drive prices higher, the state's own reports mainly show that the dominant reason health costs are rising is medical progress and technological innovation. Massachusetts health care, with its abundance of academic medical centers and high-quality specialists, is the envy of the world. This is the true target of Mr. Patrick's price controls: The goal is to engineer a cheaper system through brute force so government can pay for health care for all. What inevitably suffers is the quality of care for individual patients. Thirty states imposed hospital rate setting in the 1970s and 1980s. Except for Maryland, every one of them eventually eliminated it—including Massachusetts, in 1991—partly because it didn't control costs. And partly because it killed people. A 1988 study in the Journal of New England Medicine found that the states with the most stringent rate-setting had mortality rates 6% to 10% higher than those that didn't. All of this is merely a preview of what the entire country will face if Democrats succeed with their plan to pound ObamaCare into law in anything like its current form. Massachusetts is teaching the country a valuable lesson in how not to reform health care, if only anyone would pay attention.",R
"Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former chief medical adviser to the president, took to CNN this past weekend to sound the alarm. According to him, COVID cases are spiking, and the American people urgently need to mask up. Is anyone surprised? Fauci and his cabal crave power over everything else. But if I have anything to say about it, they won’t ever have the authority to impose mask mandates or trample our freedoms again. As we learned in the pandemic, public health bureaucrats will force compliance when the people won’t abide their recommendations. With the latest seasonal spike, they are back to their old ways. Already public health experts and university officials are calling for masks to be reimposed. Businesses and universities are reinstating mask mandates. Even an elementary school is forcibly masking children in response to a few COVID-19 cases. We all know how this goes. It starts with mask mandates, then social distancing, and then forced lockdowns to ""slow the spread."" None of it works, but it costs us dearly. It robbed us of our basic freedoms and shattered our national unity amid a crisis. We cannot let it happen again. Democrats insist they have no plans to mandate masking again. So, let’s hold them to their words and end the specter of COVID-19 tyranny for good. Today, I will go to the Senate floor to request unanimous consent on my ""Freedom to Breathe Act."" That means if no one objects, the bill passes automatically. But if Senate Democrats block my legislation, they must be planning to reinstate mask mandates once again. The bill is very simple. It prohibits government from forcing you to wear a mask on planes, on public transit, or in public schools for the next 15 months. It also blocks taxpayer dollars from being used to enforce a mask mandate. Any reasonable Democrat should be willing to agree with this legislation. It’s narrowly targeted to non-healthcare sectors; hospitals and nursing homes will still be free to issue masking and public health guidelines as they handle seasonal spikes and viral mutations. The bill also doesn’t prohibit voluntary masking. Individuals will be free to choose whether to wear a mask. Those who oppose the bill may claim to ""follow the science,"" but they’d be wrong. With years of experience and experimental study, the effects of masking are clear. There is no robust high-quality evidence that masking slows the spread of respiratory infections like COVID-19. But it can lead to unhealthy levels of CO2 inhalation, jeopardize early childhood development and exacerbate speech and language disorders. In most cases, a mask is nothing more than a false sense of protection. Many of us remember the widespread rejoicing when the last mask mandates were ended. Airline passengers cheered. School children erupted in joy. Many breathed a sigh of relief — finally unencumbered. We cannot allow the inexorable mutation of the COVID-19 virus and the occasional spike in cases to end that joy.",R
"Last week, Maria Zeee interviewed me on the Alex Jones Show (see below), and I mentioned something that everyone seems to be missing in the current maelstrom of geopolitics: That as the dollar dies, so does any other nation depending on US currency creation. Given Israel's heavy dependence on U.S. foreign air and the dollar funding of the U.S. Navy, when the dollar dies, Israel will face an existential threat of its own. It is the careless creation of trillions of dollars in US currency that powers the Pentagon, after all. It also funds government propaganda ops like what we all suffered through during the COVID years when the CDC and FDA ran a coordinated psychological operation against us all, trying to convince the weak-minded that ""emergency use"" vaccines are safe and effective at preventing infections and halting transmission. We now know, of course, it was all an engineered lie. But it was a lie made possible through currency creation. Without easy money, a nation can no longer sustain its campaign of lies. And as the dollar collapses, so will the Empire of Lies, which might as well be the new name for the U.S. State Dept and accompanying Military Industrial Complex that gains power and profit from engineered mass human suffering and death. An empire of lies needs a mountain of money printing to stay in power. This empire of lies requires a mountain of money printing to keep it afloat -- and to keep the wars active enough to justify ever-more-extreme violations of the principles that were once embraced by the ""liberal world order"" but have since been abandoned. Principles like democracy, freedom, human rights and self-determination. All four of those concepts now lie buried beneath the rubble of hospitals, universities and residential apartment buildings in Gaza, having been bombed into oblivion by a war-minded nation (Israel) propped up by a financial terrorism regime (the USA). Without aggressive money printing by the USA, Israel has no substantial financial backing from the west. Nor would Ukraine, which has nearly run its course as the puppet proxy of the west and is about to be tossed aside by western powers now that the money laundering racket has just about reached its end. The United States of America is now nearly $44 trillion in debt, and unfunded liabilities have reached an eye-popping $212 trillion (see USdebtclock.org). These numbers are beyond the comprehension of most people, which is just as well since no one in Washington D.C. is even bothering to try to bring them back to any level of reason or fiscal responsibility. Instead, the spending proceeds at a frantic pace, primarily in these three areas that I have repeatedly warned now represent the core pillars of the U.S. empire: Disease, debt and death. Disease: Nearly $1.5 trillion a year is now spent on Medicare and Medicaid, which primarily offer payouts to the ""disease industry"" known as Big Pharma and a failed system of western medicine hospitals that express near-zero proficiency in preventing disease or death. Debt: Social Security now costs the U.S. federal government nearly $1.4 trillion a year, paying American workers a fraction of what the government once stole from their paychecks, especially when considering the rapidly diminishing value of today's dollars. Death: Over $800 billion is spent each year on the ""death industry"" -- U.S. defense and war operations, which naturally focus on occupying, attacking and threatening other nations around the world while claiming to be ""protecting democracy."" These three pillars of the U.S. empire -- disease, debt and death -- are now the total obsession of western culture, where career-minded citizens flock to Big Pharma, Big Finance and Big War (the defense industry) to cash in, because that's where the money is found. But disease, debt and death do not lead to a prosperous or sustainable society. They produce short-term financial riches at the expense of long-term national abundance. You cannot bomb your way to peace and prosperity. You cannot medicate your way to good health. You cannot create wealth by counterfeiting currency. That's why the U.S. empire is collapsing. It rewarded profit, power and greed over sustainability, prosperity and liberty, all of which are necessary conditions for the kind of innovation that's required to advance a civilization. Thus, America is moving backward, not forward, and the collapse of the west -- which will include much of Western Europe, Canada, Australia and related nations -- is now far being the tipping point and cannot be halted. Once the collapse runs it's course, any nation foolish enough to be tied to the dollar -- including Argentina and Israel -- will experience the sudden loss of everything those dollars once provided. Critically for Israel, this includes the United States military armed forces (i.e. carrier strike groups), which of course cannot function without financial support. Just as the military of the former USSR collapsed and broke into a thousand pieces like Humpty Dumpty, when the dollar dies, the U.S. military shatters and cannot be put back together again. Perhaps this is the plan of the globalists all along. Either way, the level of human suffering (famine, destitution, homelessness, chaos, violence, etc.) will be unprecedented. Plan accordingly.",R
"In an overlooked congressional hearing last week, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Commissioner Mark Christie sounded the alarm about the “catastrophic state” of the U.S. energy grid. Christie opened the hearing by explaining his cause for concern: ""The United States is heading for a reliability crisis. I do not use the term 'crisis' for melodrama but because it is an accurate description of what we are facing. I think anyone would regard an increasing threat of system-wide, extensive power outages as a crisis."" Traditional coal and natural gas power plants are being retired early and at an unsustainable rate, and the new, green power generation resources that are coming online – mainly wind and solar – make the grid less predictable because they vary with weather and sunlight patterns. “Dispatchable generating resources are retiring far too quickly and in quantities that threaten our ability to keep the lights on. The problem generally is not the addition of intermittent resources, primarily wind and solar, but the far too rapid subtraction of dispatchable resources, especially coal and gas,” Christie explained. In our rush to go green, we’re reaching a perilous tipping point where our aging grid is straining to keep up with the ever-increasing supply needs for the country. While renewable power sources like wind and solar add much-needed power, they are insufficient to power the grid. The truly green answer, of course, is to build more nuclear plants, and barring that we should at least stop shutting down our coal and gas plants early. As is is, though, the amount of dispatchable power is plummeting, so the country is accelerating toward a cliff. A recent New York Times article highlighted the situation for many struggling Americans. Rolling blackouts are becoming commonplace for people across the country, and those who can’t afford backup generators and the elderly are particularly at risk for this ""new energy normal."" This article fails to ask why, in the wealthiest country on earth, with abundant energy resources, citizens have to buy generators to keep the lights on. Spoiler: It's climate change. Not all energy is created equal. In his testimony, Mr. Christie makes it very clear that the issues facing the grid are much more complex than we’ve previously been led to believe. As municipalities integrated more solar and wind options into the grid, we were promised this would make up for the retirement of fossil fuel plants. However, it’s becoming increasingly clear that these projections fall well short of what is required. Additionally, as more data has come in, the energy produced by renewables appears to be much less efficient. Renewables often have a lower capacity value than conventional fossil fuel-based power plants such as coal, natural gas, and nuclear power. Capacity value, or capacity credit, measures how much energy a power plant can produce over a given period compared to its maximum potential output. One of the main challenges associated with renewable energy sources like solar and wind power is their intermittent and variable nature. These “non-dispatchable” energy sources depend on weather conditions and the time of day, which can be unpredictable and inconsistent. For example, solar power generation is limited to daylight hours and is affected by cloud cover, while wind power generation depends on the presence and strength of wind. In contrast, dispatchable power plants, like those based on fossil fuels or nuclear fission, can produce electricity continuously and consistently as long as they have a steady fuel supply, allowing them to maintain a higher capacity value, as they can operate at or near their maximum output more consistently. The intermittency and variability of renewable energy sources create a need for energy storage solutions to balance supply and demand. However, large-scale energy storage technologies, such as batteries or pumped hydro storage, are still relatively expensive and have limited capacities, and their production is controlled by the People’s Republic of China. On the other hand, fossil fuel power plants can store significant amounts of fuel on-site to generate electricity when needed, thereby maintaining a higher capacity value. So as we’re losing vast amounts of energy capacity, it’s being replaced with renewable energy that is much less efficient. Just a few weeks ago, Manu Asthana, the CEO of the PJM regional transmission organization — the largest RTO in the country in terms of consumers served — said that PJM faced the likelihood of losing 40 gigawatts of generation capacity by 2030 through early retirements of generating units. 90% of this retiring capacity is dispatchable generation, primarily coal and gas. Meanwhile PJM faces load growth of an additional 13 gigawatts by 2030. The PJM interconnection queue, however, largely consists of intermittent generation, primarily wind and solar. In terms of capacity value — which is the amount of power that can be supplied to the grid when needed — one nameplate megawatt of wind or solar is simply not equal to one nameplate megawatt of gas, coal, or nuclear. So even if every unit waiting in the PJM interconnection queue was interconnected, that would not solve the reliability problem caused by too-rapid loss of dispatchable generation. The numbers just do not balance. The ongoing war in the Ukraine has highlighted the precarious energy situation of European member states, especially Germany. For decades Europe has pushed a green narrative increasingly disconnected from the reality of powering a continent. With the highly suspicious destruction of the Nordstream 2, Germany has lost its main natural gas supply from Russia. While the Germans have been scrambling to find alternative sources, including Norway and the U.S., the skyrocketing costs have crippled German industry. Despite these setbacks, Germany remains committed to its green push, even if it endangers its economy. Last month the country shut down its last nuclear power plant, meaning the German grid will have to survive solely on natural gas and the shifting reliability of renewables. This move confused even environmentalists, who questioned why leaders would shutter a completely clean energy supply in the middle of a war. Despite a 20-year effort and billions of euros spent, Germany still relies on fossil fuels for over 75% of its energy. Because the Germans have closed their coal and nuclear plants, most of this energy is now imported. Unfortunately, the U.S. is increasingly adopting this same model of planned energy collapse. As Doomberg points out on Substack: “Given Germany’s multi-year lead in the race to the energy bottom, how events unfold as the implementation of Energiewende enters its final stages will be an instructive case study in the disastrous consequences of pursuing green utopian fantasies.”",R
"Aside from the possible implications of the Newsom-DeSantis debate for the 2024 presidential election, there is another issue that I hope will get more play in the coming months: As Sean Hannity, himself has stressed, hopefully, the nation will take a serious look at why so many people are leaving states like California, New York, and Illinois for states like Florida, Texas, the Carolinas, and Tennessee. Is it just for lower taxes, or together with many other factors, the promise of a better life? As a native and current retiree in California, I have pondered that question myself, especially after a recent two-week trip to Tennessee, Georgia, and the Carolinas. It would be great to spend the remaining years in one of those states even if I had to give up the ideal weather of Southern California. Realistically, however, it’s just a pipe dream. All of our close relatives are here in Southern California, and our house is completely paid off. So we are not going anywhere.  But what made Gavin Newsom the loser in the debate was the undeniable comparison between California and Florida. Newsom had no credible answers for the high cost of living, taxes, gas prices, crime, lax law enforcement, homelessness, etc, all of which are driving thousands of people and businesses out of the Golden State. To use a baseball metaphor, he stepped into the batter’s box with two strikes against him. He fouled off a lot of pitches, but the facts were there for all to see. Hannity and his staff did their homework and came armed with empirical numbers that proved DeSantis’ points for him. When people vote with their legs, it’s hard to argue that they are making a big mistake. Newsom, however, basically told his audience not to believe their lying eyes. California really is a better place than Florida, he tried to argue. It just wasn’t convincing, especially to a California native and current resident who has been watching the deterioration first-hand. It is true that many residents of southern states are worried that the influx of transplants will bring their blue voting habits with them and turn red states into purple states, and eventually, into blue states. Others (like DeSantis) believe that the transplants are fleeing the political situation in blue states above all else in favor of places where people think like they do. It may turn out in the end that the transplants will strengthen the conservative (Republican numbers) in places like Tennessee, Texas, Florida, etc, and as those states gain population, they could gain more electoral votes with states like California losing electoral votes and  House of Representatives representation. All that is above my pay grade. It may be anecdotal, but I know a fair number of people who have made the move, and they tend to list as reasons the lower cost of living, quality of life, and to escape liberal government rule. Is it any coincidence that many residents of eastern Oregon have expressed their desire to secede from Oregon (a liberal state: think Portland) and join Idaho, a conservative state in stark contrast to its western neighbors of Oregon and Washington? That will likely never happen. Those folks will just have to move to Idaho, but that state is another place with a lot of transplants, including from California. Putting aside the question of how the debate affected the 2024 presidential election, I think it served a valuable purpose in getting people to think about the differences between red states and blue states. Work and family ties will keep some people (like me) in blue states, but the bottom line is which states are better places to live in overall?",R
"Delaware is often considered the corporate capital of the United States, and for good reason. The state has a long history of being business-friendly and has attracted a significant number of Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) from other states. In this article, we will explore the reasons why Delaware is such an attractive destination for LLCs, and how its business-friendly environment has helped it become a leader in the world of business and finance. One of the main reasons why Delaware is so popular among LLCs is its flexible and business-friendly laws. The state has a long-standing tradition of corporate law, dating back to the early 20th century, which has been designed to make it easy for companies to form and operate in the state. This includes a comprehensive set of laws and regulations that govern LLCs and other types of business entities, as well as a court system that is known for its expertise in corporate law. Delaware's business-friendly environment also includes a strong and well-educated workforce, which is essential for any company looking to grow and succeed. The state has a high-quality education system, with a number of top-ranked universities and colleges, which helps to ensure that there is a steady supply of highly skilled and educated workers. Additionally, the state has a number of business incubators and accelerators, which provide resources and support to help new companies get off the ground. Another key aspect of Delaware's business-friendly environment is the state's requirement for companies to appoint a registered agent. A registered agent is an individual or entity that is responsible for receiving legal documents and official correspondence on behalf of a company. This requirement is important because it ensures that companies can be reached in a timely manner in case of legal or regulatory issues. In Delaware, registered agents can be individuals or entities that are authorized to do business in the state. One of the benefits of having a registered agent in Delaware is the added level of privacy and confidentiality. Delaware laws protect the personal information of the members of an LLC, and only the registered agent's information is made publicly available. This can be particularly beneficial for companies that want to keep their ownership structure private. Additionally, registered agents in Delaware are required to maintain regular office hours and to have a physical address in the state, which ensures that legal documents and correspondence can be delivered and received promptly. Another benefit of having a registered agent in Delaware is that it allows companies to take advantage of the state's legal system. As previously mentioned, Delaware has a specialized court system that is designed to handle disputes related to corporate and business law. By having a registered agent in the state, companies can ensure that they can be properly served with legal documents and can participate in any legal proceedings that may arise. Overall, Delaware's requirement for companies to appoint a registered agent is another aspect of the state's business-friendly environment that makes it an attractive location for LLCs. It provides added privacy and confidentiality, as well as access to the state's legal system. Companies that choose Delaware as their registered agent location can ensure that they are in compliance with state laws and can take advantage of the state's legal and business resources. Another reason why Delaware is so attractive to LLCs is its favorable tax environment. Delaware has no sales tax, no personal income tax, and a low corporate income tax rate, making it an ideal location for companies that want to minimize their tax burden. Additionally, the state has a number of tax incentives and credits that are available to businesses, which can help them save money on taxes and increase their bottom line. One of the most notable features of Delaware's legal system is the ability to provide a single-member LLC. It is a type of LLC that has only one member. Single-member LLCs are often used for small businesses or for individuals who want to protect their personal assets from business liabilities. Delaware allows the formation of single-member LLCs, which can be managed by the owner, without the need for a board of directors or shareholders. This flexibility makes it an ideal choice for many entrepreneurs and small business owners. It is worth mentioning that Delaware's business-friendly environment is not just limited to LLCs, but also to corporations, partnerships, and other types of business entities. The state's corporate laws are considered among the most advanced and flexible in the world. It is also home to some of the most well-known and reputable law firms in the country, which provide a wide range of legal services to businesses of all sizes and in all industries. In summary, Delaware's business-friendly environment is a major factor that attracts LLCs from other states, and has helped it become a leader in the world of business and finance. The state's flexible and business-friendly laws, favorable tax environment, strong and well-educated workforce, reputation as a hub for business and finance, legal system designed for corporate disputes, and resources and support services for companies make it an ideal location for businesses of all sizes and in all industries. Its political climate also supports innovation, technology and economic growth which could be a great benefit for companies that choose Delaware as a location for their LLCs.",R
"Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY) ripped the political Left in a speech from the Senate floor on Wednesday over its overt anti-Semitism in the days following Hamas’ October 7 terrorist attack against Israel. Schumer, who is Jewish, said as the highest ranking elected Jew in U.S. history, he felt compelled to speak out about what is happening and about anti-Semitism that Jews have experienced worldwide throughout history. After taking a brief shot at former President Donald Trump in the opening moments of his remarks, Schumer quickly called out the woke Left as being the primary culprit of anti-Semitism as he highlighted statistics showing how anti-Semitic incidents have erupted in recent weeks. “The solidarity that Jewish Americans initially received from many of our fellow citizens was quickly drowned out by other voices,” he said. “While the dead bodies of Jewish Israelis were still warm, while hundreds of Jewish Israelis were being carried as hostages back to Hamas tunnels under Gaza, Jewish Americans were alarmed to see some of our fellow citizens characterize a brutal terrorist attack as justified because of the actions of the Israeli government.” “A vicious, bloodcurdling, premeditated massacre of innocent men, women, children, the elderly — justified!” he continued. “Even worse, in some cases, people even celebrated what happened, describing it as the deserved fate of quote ‘colonizers’ and calling for quote ‘glory to the martyrs’ who carried out these heinous attacks.” Schumer said that those anti-Semitic statements largely were not coming from the far-Right, but from “people that most liberal Jewish Americans felt previously were their ideological fellow travelers.” “Not long ago, many of us marched together for black and brown lives, we stood against anti-Asian hatred, we protested bigotry against the LGBTQ community, we fought for reproductive justice out of the recognition that injustice against one oppressed group is injustice against all,” he said. “But apparently, in the eyes of some, that principle does not extend to the Jewish people.” Schumer spoke at length about the hatred that Jews have faced throughout history and about his family’s history facing persecution before addressing specific examples of what is alarming Jews across the country. “When Jewish people hear chants like ‘From the river to the sea,’ a founding slogan of Hamas, a terrorist group that is not shy about their goal to eradicate the Jewish people, in Israel and around the globe, we are alarmed,” he said. “When we see signs in the crowd that read ‘By Any Means Necessary,’ after the most violent attack ever against Israeli civilians, we are appalled at the casual invocation of such savagery.” “When we see protesters at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade compare the genocide of the Holocaust equivalently to the Israeli army’s actions to defeat Hamas in self-defense of their people, we are shocked,” he continued. “And when we see many people and news organizations remain neutral about the basic absurdity of these claims and actions, we are deeply disappointed.”Schumer continued by labeling specific incidents as anti-Semitic: After October 7th, when boycotts were organized against Jewish businesses in Philadelphia that have nothing to do with Israel — that is anti-Semitism!After October 7th, when swastikas appeared on Jewish delis on the Upper East Side — that is anti-Semitism! After October 7th, when protesters in California shouted at Jewish Americans, “Hitler should’ve smashed you!” — that is anti-Semitism! After October 7th, when a Jewish U.S. Senator was violently threatened for her views on Israel — that is anti-Semitism! After October 7th, when students on college campuses across the country who wear a yarmulke or display a Jewish star are harassed, verbally vilified, pushed, and even spat upon and punched — that is anti-Semitism! After October 7th, when an author in a prominent left-wing magazine labeled the pro-Israel rally in Washington a “hate rally” — that is anti-Semitism! I attended the rally because I believe there should be a place of refuge for the Jewish people. Not because I wish violence on Palestinians, or any other people. And after October 7th, when students at Hillcrest High School in Queens ran rampant in the hallways and demanded the firing of a teacher just because attended a rally supporting Israel, and forced her to hide in a locked office for hours while staff struggled to regain control — that is anti-Semitism! Walking out of school to march in support of Palestinians is completely legitimate. But forcing a Jewish teacher to remain — as she described — locked in an office because she attended a rally in support for Israel is anti-Semitism, pure and simple.",R
"The first time the father of my children verbally accosted me, I had suggested locs for our then-unborn daughter. We were driving through our Jersey City neighborhood and I was six months pregnant. “You want to make all the decisions!” he screamed while angrily speeding down the road. When I tried to explain to him that he may not understand what it takes to care for a little black girl’s hair, he bellowed, “You tryna say I’m gonna be a bad father?” Violent, angry outbursts became normal in our interactions once I became pregnant. In an instant, the father of my children would go from being the warmest, most dedicated man to a monster. Then, after every eruption, he pretended like it never happened or promised it was the last time. On his first Father’s Day, he became enraged after waking up to find me absent from our shared bed. I had slipped out earlier that morning to buy us groceries to make a big breakfast. “Tell me who you were with!” he screamed. The father of my children has raged in front of my family, my neighbors, my friends, and even strangers. He uses aggression and manipulation to control me. “Abuse is never okay,” my therapist told me when I shared these stories. I nodded in response. But the phrase triggered a cascade of confusing thoughts. If abuse is never okay, why does popular culture repeatedly refer to black women as “bitches,” “hoes,” and “thots”? If abuse is never okay, why do the police abuse black people, sometimes even kill us, and then resort to victim-blaming or gaslighting to excuse their behavior? If abuse is never okay, why does America continue to abuse its black citizens? Abuse is all I’ve ever known as a black woman in this country. I alone do not have the power to fight against it. It’s a cycle that will take more than me to end it. These cycles are what black people are trying to eradicate when we talk about the need for reparations. Reparations are not just about righting the wrong of slavery itself, they are also about addressing the longstanding systemic racism that continues to impact the lives of black people to this day. It is this legacy of abuses against black people that has resulted in a complex, racist system that wreaks havoc on black lives and makes our relationships tragically set up to fail. What it means to normalize abuse as a black woman. Normalizing abuse is what often happens when you exist in racist, misogynistic American society as a black woman. I have been sexualized and degraded ever since the age of 11 when I became a part of the statistic that 60 percent of black girls are sexually assaulted before the age of 18. I have never known stability because my family had to constantly move in search of a home after being priced out of neighborhoods in Florida, New Jersey, and New York by gentrification. My mother had to work three jobs just to make ends meet, like countless black single mothers do, and I pretty much raised myself. I never had the chance to celebrate honor rolls, dean’s lists, or professional successes because they felt so small next to giant stacks of unpaid bills and obligations that can barely be met. Black women face the highest rates of domestic violence and intimate partner violence compared to any other demographic. We are also the most likely to suffer serious injury or die at the hands of our partners. A 2003 study analyzed the prevalence of domestic violence in the black community and found intimate partner violence in black relationships is not only more common, but also more violent than among white couples. The University of Maryland and Indiana University researchers explained that “the anger, hatred, and frustrations of African American men, caused by institutional racism, are being displaced onto their wives and lovers.” As a black woman, I’ve spent my life battling both covert and overt racism and misogyny, a wretched combination, inside and outside of my own home. Sometimes I believe it is this perfect-storm combination that makes me an easy target for abusive relationships. Abuse doesn’t have to ever be “okay” for it to be normal. It just has to be a fact of life. Abuse was a fact of life for my kids’ father as well. His parents used corporal punishment as a form of discipline as long as he could remember. They beat him with belts, belt buckles, tree branches, and wires. They made him kneel on graters for hours at a time. And while studies have found that black parents are twice as likely as white parents to use corporal punishment, they also highlight the truth that this is a practice adopted from white Europeans during slavery. In other words, slavery is not “just in the past.” What black people adopted as a result of enslavement continues to haunt us and torment our physical and psychological well-being beginning in childhood and well into adulthood. Reparations are about righting cycles of oppression. My kids’ father was raised in the poor, urban part of Jersey City where violence was the norm — an area “ghettoized’ by discriminatory New Jersey banking policies that made it practically impossible for minorities to get loans for “good” (i.e. white) neighborhoods. For his Haitian immigrant parents, purchasing an affordable home was their taste of “The American Dream.” They left their homeland — a country forced to pay the modern equivalent of $21 billion in reparations in 1825 to former French slave owners after Haitians won their freedom from the colonial power, consequently making it the poorest nation in the Western hemisphere — just to realize that dream. For their son, who had to navigate the trauma of living in the “hood,” like getting stopped and frisked by police since grade school and getting jumped over false accusations, it was more of a nightmare. He learned to always be suspicious and on edge. “Anyone can just flip on you,” he used to explain about growing up never knowing the difference between friends and enemies. I witnessed it myself. About two years ago, a friend of his showed up at our home threatening him with a gun. He was angry because his car got repossessed while my partner was holding onto it for him while he visited family for two weeks. “You let them take my car!” the friend screamed, even though he had not paid his car note in months. I don’t know why his friend couldn’t make the payments, but I do know that black men are the most likely to be unemployed, underemployed, or deemed unemployable “convicts.” I also know how hard it is to take personal responsibility for your own circumstances when they always feel so outside of your control. I know his anger was misdirected and may seem illogical, but it likely has a valid source. Black people have been dominated and oppressed by white supremacy that constantly evolves and becomes more clandestine over the centuries. From slavery, Black Codes, Jim Crow, CIA and FBI attacks on Civil Rights era leaders, redlining, the school-to-prison pipeline, health care inequality, employment discrimination, mass incarceration, lead poisoning our water systems, and police violence, we often forget that it is these unknown destructive forces in our lives that should be the source of our scorn. It is no surprise that we sometimes take out our anger on one another. For black people, the call for reparations begins with the desire for white people to grapple with the atrocity of slavery. Can white people imagine how truly infuriating it is to know the only people who received reparations when slavery came to an end were white slave owners? Like slave-holding French colonizers, American slave owners received $300 per freed slave after Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation in 1862. And yet, Americans readily dismiss the country’s need to atone for its original sin. But the need for reparations, just like the white history of oppressing and discriminating against black people, does not end there. Many scholars argue that reparations are the only remedy to address the substantial black/white wealth gap that no education, job, or income will ever close. For millions of black people living in poverty, reparations may be the only way to ensure the affordability of proper mental health services. Or the only way the segregated school system, in which zip code and property taxes often correlate with educational opportunity, can finally give black children access to high-quality learning. For those in redlined “ghettos” or those with subprime mortgages that are disproportionately dealt out to people of color, reparations may finally give them access to homeownership in good neighborhoods, or they may finally be able to afford to build, maintain, and protect their own. America will remain separate and very unequal if there is no commitment to addressing its racist abuse. Families like mine will continue to be torn apart by deep-seated trauma because we lack the resources to do anything about it. We need to heal from centuries of trauma. We need to rebuild our communities and mend our relationships with one another. We cannot do so while buried in debts and hardship. There is only so much work I can do alone. “Abuse is a choice,” my therapist often reiterates.That has been the hardest fact for me to confront: that abuse is knowingly and intentionally inflicted. For a long time, I allowed myself to believe my partner was “out of it” when behaving the way that he was, a lie I told myself to explain why a man who claimed he loved me could treat me the way he did. I battled with the same cognitive dissonance for all of my life over my relationship with America. “If only I work harder,” I told myself. I tried to work harder. Per the suggestion of our counselors, we attended individual therapy once a week and couples therapy once a month. Things seemed to be looking up — until we received the first bill. We were shocked that, despite the fact that we both had insurance, the co-pays amounted to $400 a month. For a new family already buried in student loans and struggling to find affordable housing, paying that amount was unsustainable. After a few months, we stopped going. And the relationship, like my relationship with the country, remained abusive and one-sided. But I hold out a little bit of hope. My kids’ father has agreed to seek therapy again. Meanwhile, talk of reparations has come up in the 2020 presidential campaign. Most Democratic candidates, at the very least, agree that the government should move forward with Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee’s H.R. 40 bill put forth to establish a commission to study slavery and the oppressive discriminatory practices that followed, to begin to find a solution. Maybe America is finally ready, like my partner, to take the first step on the long journey to righting its wrongs against people who share my hue. In the next couple of years, two of the most important relationships in my life will either move forward — strengthened by true reconciliation, where amends are made — or wither away, leaving behind a damaging continued legacy of abuse and hurt. I am a black woman who is tired of unkept promises: from lovers, from bosses, from political candidates, from society as a whole. I am ready for my abusers to make good on their promises of “change.” Because I can’t live like this. And I refuse to blame myself any longer.",D
"Speaker of the House Mike Johnson wrote the foreword and publicly promoted a 2022 book that spread baseless and discredited conspiracy theories and used derogatory homophobic insults. Written by Scott McKay, a local Louisiana politics blogger, the book, “The Revivalist Manifesto,” gives credence to unfounded conspiracy theories often embraced by the far-right – including the “Pizzagate” hoax, which falsely claimed top Democratic officials were involved in a pedophile ring, among other conspiracies. The book also propagates baseless and inaccurate claims, implying that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts was subjected to blackmail and connected to the disgraced underage sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Other sections of the book defend podcaster Joe Rogan from racism charges after it was revealed he used the N-word, which Rogan later apologized for. The book also disparages poor voters as “unsophisticated and susceptible to government dependency” and easy to manipulate with “Black Lives Matter ‘defund the police’ pandering.” “Scott McKay presents a valuable and timely contribution with The Revivalist Manifesto because he has managed here to articulate well what millions of conscientious, freedom-loving Americans are sensing,” Johnson writes in his 300-word foreword. Johnson’s endorsement of the book extends beyond the foreword: In 2022, he actively promoted the book on his public social media platforms and even dedicated an episode of his podcast he co-hosts with his wife to hosting McKay. During the podcast episode, Johnson expressed his belief in the book, stating, “I obviously believe in the product, or I wouldn’t have written the foreword. So I endorse the work.” He also referred to McKay as a “dear friend” and highlighted that the book “really could make some waves.” Over the years, Johnson had written opinion pieces for McKay’s blog, the Hayride, and engaged with the author on public platforms like Facebook. Since he was elevated to the speakership in October, Johnson’s views from his time as a socially conservative attorney, state lawmaker and Louisiana congressman have come under increased scrutiny – particularly his views on homosexuality which he has called an “inherently unnatural” and “dangerous” lifestyle and even blamed it, in part, for the fall of the Roman Empire. Following publication of this story, a spokesman for Johnson told CNN he did not read passages of McKay’s book highlighted by CNN and said he strongly disagreed with them. “The Speaker had never read the passages highlighted in the CNN story which he strongly disagrees with. He wrote the foreword as a favor to a friend, supportive of the general theme of the book but not as an endorsement of all the opinions expressed.” CNN reached out to McKay, who called the story a “hit piece” on social media. Reviving Pizzagate. In his book, McKay insinuates that hacked emails from Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign chairman John Podesta contained coded references hinting involvement in “child sex trafficking” because of “unexplained references” to “hot dogs and pizza,” resembling alleged code words used by pedophiles. “The Pizzagate scandal was born, and though some of the most outlandish allegations made in it were clearly disproven, other elements were not; the whole thing just seemed to be dismissed as debunked, and no explanation was ever given,” he writes. While McKay remains ambiguous in his book regarding the elements he asserts weren’t disproven, he explicitly writes on his public Facebook page that the conspiracy related to code words was not debunked and goes as far as labeling Podesta as a pedophile. Despite framing conspiracy theories as inquiries in his book, McKay often openly endorses these claims on his public social media platforms. Jared Holt, an expert on right wing conspiracy theories at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think-tank that studies disinformation, told CNN that Johnson’s promotion of the book raised questions about the new House speaker’s judgment. The book contains “the lurid daydreams of certain online far-right sentiments,” said Holt. “His leadership may open the door for those unpopular fringes to weld disproportionate political power.” Homophobic slurs and disparaging poor voters. The book repeatedly disparages Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, calling the former mayor a “queer choice” for the Cabinet position and saying he had “queer sanctimony” and was “openly, and obnoxiously, gay.” At one point, the book labels him “Gay Mayor Pete Buttigieg.” Another section takes aim at poor voters, who the author calls, “unsophisticated and susceptible to government dependency” and says they are easily manipulated with “bowdlerizing old monuments, or midnight basketball, or Black Lives Matter ‘defund the police’ pandering.” While McKay’s reference was to poor voters nationwide, Louisiana often ranks among the poorest states in the United States when measured by the share of citizens living below the poverty line. Midnight basketball refers to late-night basketball leagues designed to steer young people away from potential involvement in crime by offering engagement during peak crime hours. McKay’s book also shares other unfounded conspiracy theories, including the debunked claim that the Democratic National Committee’s emails in 2016 were not hacked but leaked by a staffer named Seth Rich. In 2020, Rich’s parents settled a lawsuit with Fox News, stemming from the network’s publication of a retracted story connecting their son’s murder to right-wing conspiracy theories. The book denies that carbon dioxide is linked to climate change and frequently mocks the climate crisis as “hysteria.” The book also spreads a conspiracy theory that the Biden administration deliberately allowed undocumented immigrants into the country to turn them into voters. The book targets and taunts prominent Democratic officials, including calling Interior Secretary Deb Haaland “half oppressed” because her mother is Native American and father is of Norwegian descent and writes that former President Barack Obama’s “chief selling point was that he was black.” McKay also adds that the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, a frequent foe of Donald Trump, used his time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam “as a political get-out-of-jail-free card.”",D
"A young Canadian named Kristoffer Nippak is a key player in the growing neo-Nazi network of “Active Clubs,” VICE News can exclusively reveal. With more than 10 cells sprinkled across multiple provinces, the Active Clubs are the fastest-growing neo-Nazi movement in Canada. Meeting several times a month, members of the semi-autonomous cells train martial arts, put up racist posters, and recruit young, easily manipulated white men to their cause. On October 18, the Active Club network celebrated its two-year anniversary and members from each cell met in Ontario to train and discuss further plans. Now, just weeks removed from this meetup, VICE News can reveal the identity of one of the key players who laid the groundwork for the national Active Club scene in Canada. Nippak is a 25-year-old Ontario man who, for years now, has dedicated his life to spreading hatred; he was a founding member of the Canadian offshoot of Atomwaffen, a group that has been connected to five murders and is designated a terrorist organization in Canada. What's more, Nippak isn't just a key player in building the Active Club scene in Canada—he’s helped the group spread overseas as well. VICE News was able to identify Nippak as a key leader in the Active Club scene and a founding member of Canada’s Atomwaffen cell through interviews with sources in the neo-Nazi community, law enforcement, and researchers, and online posts sources say Nippak wrote. One person familiar with Nippak’s white-supremacist organizing told VICE News he’s obsessed with spreading neo-Nazism. “This is his life,” this person, who was granted anonymity because of fear of safety, says.”It’s all he does.” Nippak didn't respond to multiple requests for comment sent to his Telegram accounts or accounts connected to the Canadian Active Club network. The Telegram accounts associated with Nippak, which are normally active multiple times every day, went silent for almost a week following the VICE News request for comment. While no response was received from several of the men who vet potential members for Active Club Canada, the account used by VICE News to contact them was blocked by the main page as well as by some of the vetters. VICE News connected with Erik Nippak, Kristoffer’s father, on Facebook to ask for comment and contact information for his son, but was likewise blocked shortly after sending the request. Other requests to family members and friends went unanswered. Nippak has, according to sources and online posts connected to him, traveled the world attempting to build and strengthen the international network of racist fitness clubs. This has involved him traveling to Scandinavia, where he gladhanded and sparred with Swedish skinheads and neo-Nazis. In Canada, Nippak has aided in building a deep and active neo-Nazi movement that features not just dozens of dedicated male supporters, but also includes a women's group and even a racist clothing brand. Alexander Ritzmann, a senior advisor of the Counter-Extremism Project, has been a leading expert on Active Clubs and their international spread. He told VICE News that in the United States, the Active Clubs appear to be building “a militia that looks like a combat sports network.” ""There's lots of evidence suggesting that this is actually a shadow militia that is training and preparing for a Day X scenario. One that is undefined at the moment—it could be something like January 6, it could be something else,” said Ritzmann. “So it is very relevant when some of the leadership has a past of being members in outward, violent organizations.” Nippak has been active in the white power movement for years now. Like others in the movement, he has little to no online footprint under his real name. What can be found online about him either predates his involvement in the movement, or was shared by outside groups. One photo posted by a Estonian language school in which he appears, for example, refers to everyone in the photo by their full name, but to Nippak only by his initials. Even in photos posted on family members' personal social media pages, Nippak is never named.  Thanks to archived websites reviewed by VICE News—they are not being named to avoid drawing an unfair connection between them and neo-Nazism—we can see that Nippak is of Estonian descent, and spent time in Estonian schools and camps while he was younger. An online blog apparently written by Nippak frequently mentions his heritage alongside relentless promotion of Estonian Active Clubs. While little is known about his radicalization, we do know he’s been in the scene since he was a teenager. “I have been a National Socialist for many years now, I won't be exact. And not just online but in the real world,” reads the blog post. (VICE News was told by a knowledgeable source that Nippak wrote the post, and the heritage, travels, and connections of the writer match those of Nippak.) “Many National Socialists in multiple countries know who I am personally. “I work a regular job, and then also spend lots of time involved in Nationalist organizing and activism. Often these days I don't even have time for my own family.” One of his first projects was banding together with other militant neo-Nazis in Canada to try and form an Atomwaffen cell. Atomwaffen was an infamous neo-Nazi terrorist organization that emerged in 2016, and has been linked to five murders in the United States. The group was openly accelerationist, meaning it was built around the idea of hastening the fall of society so it could build a white ethnostate. As the overtly edgy and militant aesthetic of Atomwaffen fell out of style in the neo-Nazi scene following several high-profile law enforcement operations and some members went underground, Nippak remained, for lack of a better term, active. When the Active Clubs began to spread across North America, including in Canada, Nippak took notice.  Active Clubs are essentially semi-autonomous neo-Nazi fight clubs. They're organized on a local level around racists training in martial arts—primarily jiu-jitsu and kickboxing—as well as performing on-the-ground activism like stickering, postering, and (more frequently as of late) showing up at hot-button issue protests. The network was founded by American white supremacist Robert Rundo, who was recently extradited from Romania to the U.S. to face charges linked to violent clashes with antifascists in 2017. Rundo has said that he was inspired by the European neo-Nazi combat scene, which he hoped to emulate in North America.",D
"The Israeli Defense Forces brutal assault on Gaza leading to 16,000 deaths and vast destruction has received fulsome support from the Biden administration and US imperialism. This makes them complicit in the war crimes and mass ethnic cleansing being carried out in Gaza and increased killings on the West Bank. It is also completely in line with the longstanding position that Israel is the US’s key ally in the region which must be backed at all costs. But that support has limits. The US does not want a regional war breaking out with Iran and its allied forces like Hezbollah in Lebanon, which back Hamas. This would have massive and hard to predict consequences. The situation in the Middle East today also cannot be separated from the New Cold War between US imperialism and Chinese imperialism for global economic and military hegemony. The US is using the war to reassert its dominant “security” role in the region, as guarantor not just for the Israeli regime but for a whole series of Arab dictatorships. This is at the same time as the IDF’s brutal campaign undermines the positions of those regimes as mass opposition breaks out on the streets from Jordan to Morocco. The reassertion of US power is indirectly pushing back against the increased Chinese role in the Middle East in the past period, through its Belt and Road investment program and increasing diplomatic efforts. But at the very same time that the US is asserting itself, its underlying strength is also waning. US imperialism and the Iranian regime both want to use the crisis in Gaza to undermine the influence of the other. Neither side wants an all-out regional war across the Middle East, but the possibility is baked into the logic of the situation. The day after the IDF’s invasion of Gaza, Iran’s ally Hezbollah in Lebanon was skirmishing on Israel’s northern border, risking a repeat of the brutal 2006 Israeli invasion of Lebanon or possibly worse. Besides the carnage in Gaza, at least 250 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank as right-wing settlers, backed by the IDF, have been using the war in Gaza as a cover to increase attacks including theft of land. This risks opening up another major front in the war, which would among other things lead to massive upheaval in Jordan. 6,000 people protested the Jordanian government’s lack of response in mid-October. 500 protesters tried to march from Jordan into the West Bank, risking an escalation. Jordanian police violently dispersed them before they reached Israeli checkpoints. The Jordanian monarchy is a key ally of US imperialism, and the US maintains and defends its airbases in return for access. US imperialism can’t maintain its position without risking getting directly involved. A week into the conflict, militias under Iranian control began attacking US troops in Iraq and Syria. Biden also deployed two US aircraft carriers and 2,000 marines as a deterrence to Iran and its allies. On October 27th, Biden ordered airstrikes on the bases of two “Iranian-backed militias” in Syria in order to “protect and defend our personnel.” A month later, the US military claims Iran and its allies have carried out 151 attacks against US troops. In one case, a drone ladened with explosives launched by an “Iranian-backed militia” crashed through the upper window of a US military barracks, but failed to detonate. Dozens of American troops could have been killed, guaranteeing some kind of escalation. A US defense official said “[Iran is] aiming to kill. We have just been lucky.” At a press conference on November 15, a bipartisan group of US senators told reporters that the “US is lucky that no Americans have died from the attacks”, implying Biden isn’t doing enough to protect US military personnel. They introduced a resolution urging Biden to keep “all options on the table” to deal with Iran. When asked how the US should respond, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham pointed towards war with Iran, saying if the attacks continue, the “right response militarily would be in my view to hit the [Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] training bases and infrastructure inside of Iran.” While Graham is a particularly rabid warmonger, this position would spread rapidly in the political establishment if there was a successful attack by Iranian proxies. With his approval ratings already at new lows over his handling of the situation in the Middle East, Biden does not need a public debate about whether he is committed to protecting US soldiers. All Republican primary candidates have blamed Biden for emboldening Iran by being too soft. Last month, Trump said “[Iran] didn’t have that level of aggression with me… This would have never happened with me.” Biden wants to maintain focus on reining in China, not an escalating war with Iran and its proxy militias throughout the region. Biden knows a war with Iran would be deeply unpopular. In 2019, only 18% of Americans, including only 25% of Republicans, supported military action to stop Iran from building nuclear weapons, though this could change for a period if US troops are killed and a propaganda campaign were waged to support Israel by attacking Iran. However, polls currently show Trump beating Biden in 2024. Only 14% of Americans believe Biden’s policies have made them better off. Biden’s weak political position can increase the pressure to “act decisively” against Iran in the next period depending on developments. The Iranian government has its own crises. Just over a year ago the regime was rocked by mass protests and strikes that were sparked by the murder of Jina (Masa) Amini, but developed into a much deeper critique of Iran’s capitalist, anti-worker, reactionary regime, linked to struggles by workers and oppressed nationalities. Any opportunity to whip up anti-American sentiment would be welcomed by the regime. This does not mean the Iranian regime wants an all-out military confrontation with US imperialism. They would prefer to use their nuclear ambitions as a bargaining chip to lift the sanctions that have scared off Western investors, and crippled the economy. Furthermore, US imperialism has surrounded Iran, and while not capable of invading and occupying Iran, dramatically outguns the Iranian military. However, the Iranian military could cause lots of problems for US imperialism. Even a threat of missiles or mines could shut down the Straits of Hormuz, where Iran controls one side of this 30-mile-wide bottleneck at the end of the Persian Gulf through which one-fifth of the world’s oil production moves on tankers. Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen have also carried out drone attacks against “vital” Saudi Arabian oil facilities, recently seized a cargo ship in the Red Sea, and allegedly attacked an Israeli-owned ship in the Indian Ocean. Analysts predict a wider escalation of the war along these lines could raise oil prices to $150 a barrel (almost twice as much as today’s prices). This would guarantee a new global economic downturn, with political implications all around the world. European warmongers would face renewed complications in justifying their support for the ongoing bloodbath in Ukraine, China would more firmly solidify its energy ties (and political ties) with Putin, and Biden would face even more challenges heading into a difficult election against Trump next year. These effects would become causes of new problems, and highlight why the massacre currently taking place in Gaza is intricately tied to the inter-imperialist rivalries that increasingly shape world politics and capitalism’s Age of Disorder. While these developments are increasingly the source of nightmares for capitalists, they are already creating a living hell for working-class people in many countries – nowhere more so than in the streets of Gaza and the trenches in Eastern Ukraine. The US is now also in danger of overextending itself in the New Cold War with significant commitments in Ukraine, the Middle East, and East Asia. The chaotic and humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 was meant to free up US imperialism to complete its long-planned “pivot” to East Asia, including a massive military buildup in the Western Pacific. This buildup is indeed well underway. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 was seen by the Biden administration as a major opportunity to consolidate its bloc, first and foremost by strengthening NATO. While certainly seeking to militarily degrade China’s main ally Russia, the other message of NATO’s massive support for Ukraine was meant for China itself, to demonstrate the consequences of any attempt to invade Taiwan. But now, by the admission of Ukraine’s top military commander, Gen. Valery Zaluzhny, the conflict is locked in a bloody stalemate. Reports in the Western media point to the military advantage actually beginning to shift to Russia in the coming months. On top of this there is increasing opposition within the Republican Party in the House of Representatives to sending more military aid to Kyiv. This wing is following Trump’s line that the Ukraine war is a waste of time and a distraction from the conflict with China itself. Thus the escalating crisis in the Middle East comes at a very delicate point for the US and the Biden administration. And it was also unexpected. Literally a week before the October 7 Hamas attack on Southern Israel, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said, “The Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades.” Compounding the other problems is that already low support for US imperialism globally, but especially in the neocolonial world, has taken another massive hit. The American media already admitted that it was losing the global battle for “hearts and minds” over the war in Ukraine. But the fulsome backing of the IDF’s brutal invasion of the Gaza Strip removes any remaining credibility to US claims that it is standing up for small nations and their right of self determination against the aggression of “dictators.” Of course the only thing US imperialism truly “stands for” is its “right” to dominate the world economy. And this domination is clearly waning. Backing the Israeli military to the hilt is a bipartisan position in Congress, despite some limited dissent in the Democratic Party. But this is only making the wider situation more acute. Biden is seeking to tie military aid to Israel to further military aid for Ukraine. But this is far from a done deal.  Now questions are being asked by the US’s Asian allies about whether the US is going to be bogged down in the Middle East for an extended period. Is this like the post-9/11 period where the US was “pulled back in” to the Middle East? Does the US have the capacity to fulfill all its commitments? A recent New York Times article entitled “Is America Stretched Too Thin to Stay Ahead of China” (11/10/23) said that while US allies in East and South Asia had varying views about the conflict in Israel/Palestine: “…what these countries all share are questions about how Washington’s entanglement with another distant war, on top of Ukraine, will be weighed against the needs of the Indo-Pacific. Many are asking: How many pledges of support to how many nations can the United States – a power stretched thin abroad and politically divided at home – actually handle?” They go on to point to the specific problem of armaments and “military aid,” a central part of US imperialism’s “hard power”: “The defense industry in the United States has struggled with shortages of ammunition being provided to both Ukraine and Israel, including 155-millimeter artillery shells. guided munitions and more complex American systems are also being funneled to both conflicts, even as American partners in the Indo-Pacific wait for weapons deliveries of their own.” The situation today, however, is not at all the same as 2001. The US is locked in a global competition with China. Ukraine, the Middle East and the “Indo-Pacific” are all fronts in this conflict. In the Middle East, China has sought to build its economic and diplomatic influence in the region. Iran is clearly part of its bloc. The Chinese helped reestablish relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia, regional rivals, a diplomatic coup that helped to reduce Iran’s isolation. The US has pushed back on the Belt and Road economic partnerships by announcing a commitment to infrastructure investment in the wider region at the recent G20 meeting. The Israel/Palestine war has allowed the US to reassert its regional role in a very heavy handed way, moving two aircraft carrier groups to the Eastern Mediterranean as well as two thousand Marines. China has been reduced mostly to a spectator but it is certainly gaining indirectly from the collapse of US imperialism’s ideological “democracy vs autocracy” campaign and Beijing’s propaganda as a “peace maker”. But in the end it is the situation in the Western Pacific that is most critical. The US will not lose sight of this but can indeed become bogged down and overstretched as it is arguably right now. The advantage in this conflict can shift as it has several times before. Both sides have serious problems with China, in particular, facing a profound economic crisis. But problems are also accumulating for US imperialism. It can be argued that it is not in the “rational interests” of the US and Israel or Iran and China to see the war in the Middle East widen, and that would be true. But outcomes in a world dominated by conflicting imperialist interests are often far from rational. The only force that can end the madness that is fueling wars and global conflict is the international working class, because it has the power to end capitalism which is the root of modern imperialism. The international mass movement against the assault on Gaza is a very positive step and is already having effects. Socialist Alternative (part of International Socialist Alternative) has a consistent opposition to all imperialism. Join us in the fight for a socialist future!",D
"Wealthy nations should divert 5% of their military budgets to climate finance, advocates argue. The call comes as global leaders at Cop28 in Dubai gather for a special-themed day on “relief, recovery, and peace” on Sunday, marking the first time climate-fueled conflict has ever been on an international climate conference agenda. Participants will discuss the need to direct aid to “highly vulnerable, fragile, and conflict-affected communities” as evidence mounts that climate disasters put regions at greater risk of war, and amid ongoing conflict in Palestine as well as Ukraine, Sudan, and other areas. But truly protecting communities from climate and conflict will require a shift in priorities, says the Transnational Institute, an international research and advocacy group. “Money is being spent on militarization rather than on climate action,” said Nick Buxton, a researcher with the Transnational Institute, “though the climate crisis is the biggest [common] security threat that we face today.” By diverting just 5% of global military budgets, the world could raise $110.4bn for climate finance – more than enough to meet a repeatedly broken annual climate finance target of $100bn, the organization has found. “National – and global – security in the 21st century will depend on limiting the rise in temperature and resulting havoc more than on any other thing,” said the environmental activist and author Bill McKibben. The world’s militaries produce at least 5.5% of greenhouse gas emissions – more than the total footprint of Japan – according to one 2022 estimate. But no country is required to provide data on military emissions thanks to successful lobbying by the US at the Kyoto conference in 1997. Leaders removed the exemption in 2015 but made reporting military emissions optional.Military spending has grown by more than a quarter in the past decade, exceeding $2.2tn in 2022. During the same time period, attempts to mobilize funds for climate finance have faltered.In 2009, for instance, rich countries agreed to spend $100bn on climate finance for developing world annually by 2020, but they broke that promise, providing only $90bn for climate finance in 2021. Preliminary data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development released this month indicates that the $100bn goal may have finally been met in 2022, but some experts say that assessment is based on inflated numbers. A 2022 investigation from Oxfam concluded that due to wealthy nations’ “dishonest and misleading” accounting, climate finance estimates in 2020 were as much as 225% too high. Even if it turns out wealthy nations genuinely met the commitment, said Buxton, countries should still reallocate 5% of their military budgets. The $100bn number is widely understood to be far below the true need in poor countries; one 2022 report found that developing nations need $1tn per year to cope with the climate crisis. Highly polluting nations will also need to come up with funding for loss and damage in poor countries. The need is already greater than $400bn annually and rising, by one estimate. Countries with the largest militaries – largely the richest, most polluting nations – should bear the most responsibility for cutting global defense spending, the researchers say. They place particular focus on Nato, whose 31 members include the UK, Canada and the US, whose military, which is the world’s top-funded, is also the world’s largest institutional emitter. Nato members accounted for more than half of all global military spending last year, and budgets are expected to rise. This year, members made “an enduring commitment to invest at least 2%” of their national budgets to their militaries. If that promise is fulfilled, by 2028, the additional funding would be enough to pay for all needed climate adaptation in hard-hit countries for seven years, the researchers calculated based on United Nations data. Increased militarization harms climate-affected countries in other ways, too, the researchers say. For instance, they found that Nato members are currently selling arms to 39 of the 40 most climate-vulnerable countries; 17 of which are already in armed conflict. “It’s a real perversion: rather than providing support for communities we are actually making the situation more dangerous and more unstable,” said Buxton. Diverting some military spending to climate finance would make the world safer, said Perry O’Brien, climate justice organizer at US veteran-led advocacy group Common Defense. “We know true national security means protecting people and communities from harm,” he said.",D
"Ohio voters on Tuesday overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure that will codify abortion rights in the state constitution, according to the New York Times. Issue 1—which will also enshrine the right to make decisions about birth control, miscarriage care, and fertility treatment—passed by a vote of 58% to 42%, with about 40% of the ballots in. An NBC News exit poll found that 60% of Ohio voters were unhappy with the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. The victory came despite Republicans waging an all-out misinformation campaign on the amendment by claiming it would do things like strip parental rights and allow rapists to force survivors to have abortions. The pro-choice position has now won in all seven states that have put abortion on the ballot since the fall of Roe, with Ohio becoming the first “affirmative” abortion victory in a Republican-leaning state. (Previous pro-choice wins in red states like Kansas and Kentucky came via voters rejecting anti-abortion measures with a “no” vote. Affirmative abortion votes have come in the heavily Democratic states of California, Michigan, and Vermont.) In 2020, Donald Trump won 53% of the vote in Ohio to Joe Biden’s 45%. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D) told reporters before the race was called that Ohioans are pro-choice. Manu Raju tweeted that Brown told him: “Ohio has a 6-week ban. The Republicans have done all they can to obscure that, to make it sound like ‘we should be doing something reasonable, let the legislators do what they want.’  Conservatives and activists desperately wanted to break their losing streak on statewide abortion votes, but Ohio lawmakers’ zeal to try to thwart the ballot measure may have come back to bite them. Buckeye state Republicans tried everything to stop Issue 1, including authorizing an August special election on whether to raise the threshold that ballot measures need to pass from 50% to 60%. That effort failed by a stunning 14 points, and it cost the anti-abortion side a lot of time, money, and goodwill with voters. (A little more than 3 million voters turned out in August for that proxy vote on abortion.) Gov. Mike DeWine (R) stayed out of the August election, but appeared in a lecturing ad claiming that Issue 1 is “just not right for Ohio.” DeWine obscured the fact that the ballot measure would be the deciding factor in whether a six-week abortion ban he signed in 2019 would snap back into effect, and he made other absurd claims about what would happen if people voted for it. DeWine won re-election last year by 25 points, but it appears people don’t care to listen to him when it comes to bodily autonomy. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose (R), who is running to be the Republican nominee for Senate in 2024, also got involved. He ordered the purge of nearly 27,000 inactive voters in late September but didn’t announce the move as his office has done in the past. LaRose also drafted an amendment summary that appears at the top of the ballot that replaced the word “fetus” with “unborn child.” The state Supreme Court—where Gov. DeWine’s son Patrick serves as a justice—upheld the changes, and yet the amendment still passed. In recent weeks, pro-choice supporters did begin to worry when two major newspapers made unexpected moves: The editorial board of Cleveland.com refused to take a side—instead allowing board members to write short essays on their stance—while the board at the Toledo Blade came out against Issue 1. But it appears those actions didn’t matter. Ohioans have been waiting to hear if the state Supreme Court will uphold the currently blocked six-week abortion ban, but now that Issue 1 passed and the right to choose an abortion will go in the state constitution, the ban has no legal legs to stand on. National groups seized on the Ohio election as a potential turning point. David Bereit, an anti-abortion activist who founded the group 40 Days for Life said during a webcast in late October that groups like his were banking a lot on the results. “This is not just Ohio’s struggle. For all of us, this is a national tipping point moment,” he said, per Politico. “The outcome here can and will dictate the trajectory for the entire United States, whether it’s to bolster or to thwart the abortion agenda from coast to coast.” That trajectory is now decidedly pro-abortion.",D
"It looks like things turned up a notch in the viral incident of a white high schooler punching a Black girl in an alleged racist attack. The white student in question has been slammed with a felony charge in connection to the incident. Shawnee Mission East High School sophomore Brey’anna Brown was seen in a video published by the Kansas City Defender confronting two white girls about using racial slurs. After they walked away, a 15-year-old white boy told Brown to “shut the fuck up” and started calling her the n-word. In the video, the boy pushed her and the two got into a scuffle that resulted in Brown’s nose being broken nose before a teacher finally broke them up. Brown told KSHB she didn’t expect to get into a physical fight but she was making split-second decisions in the moment. “The thought in my head was either, I protect myself, or I run away from it or I get beat up, and I don’t know what else to do, so I chose to stand up for myself,” said Brown. Brown confirmed she was suspended following the incident. However, the report says she’s not the only one who received a punishment. In Missouri, aggravated battery is considered a form of assault which can range anywhere from a Class A misdemeanor to a Class E felony. There’s been no talk of whether the boy’s use of racial slurs have been considered in his charge. It’s also unclear at the moment whether the boy is going to prosecuted as an adult or a minor. The students at Shawnee Mission East may consider this a victory following their protest earlier this week, criticizing the school for not giving a proper response regarding the incident. However, the fight isn’t over. The report says a country-wide protest has been organized for Thursday evening by the Black Student Solidarity Network echoing the demands of the students: an apology to Brown from the school for suspending her and giving the boot to the student accused of attacking her.",D
"Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund, sees the power and influence artificial intelligence has had on society and thinks it’s just as much “part of the whole evolutionary process” as any new technological invention, he said during an onstage interview at the Fortune Global Forum in Abu Dhabi yesterday (Nov. 29).The billionaire investor believes we are in a critical moment of global economic history. Just as the industrial revolution created tools that significantly reduced the need for human labor in agriculture, Dalio said A.I. will change how we think and process information—hopefully for the better. “It is archaic for people to think the decision making just in your head is going to be good,” Dalio told Fortune editor-in-chief Alan Murray in the interview. “There has to be a partnership between what’s in your head and what the computer does, because it’s so powerful in some many other ways.” He added that, while investors will naturally start pouring funding into companies developing A.I. technology, the real value will come from businesses that effectively use it. “They’re the ones that are going to create the transformations,” Dalio said. Dalio has a “five-force” framework that he uses to analyze global economy and technology is one of them. When asked if the economic benefits of new technology would outweigh the potential consequences of an economic slowdown in the coming years coupled with growing geopolitical risks, Dalio said it depends on how well the people and leaders of the world can collaborate. He also encouraged others to broaden their economic understanding beyond a U.S. perspective. “I come back to this basic notion: you need to be together, you need to be civil,” Dalio said, “When I look back at this global setting, I’m looking at the places that are financially sound, work well together and raise their kids to be civil.” The world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater manages over $124 billion in assets. Dalio himself is estimated to be worth $15.4 billion, according to Forbes. The Dalio Family Office, his personal investment firm, opened a new office in Abu Dhabi in April. The family office opened a branch in Singapore in 2020.",D
"Donald Trump hasn’t talked much about policy in this election cycle, except for vague assertions that he’ll somehow bring back low unemployment and low inflation — which, by the way, has already happened. (Unemployment has been at or below 4 percent for almost two years. Thursday’s report on consumer spending showed the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of underlying inflation getting close to its 2 percent target.) Most of his energy seems to be devoted to the prospect of wreaking revenge on his political opponents, whom he promises to “root out” like “vermin.” Nonetheless, over the past few days, Trump has declared that if he returns to the White House, he’ll once again seek to do away with the Affordable Care Act, the reform that has produced a significant decline in the number of Americans without health insurance. Why this renewed assault? “Obamacare Sucks!!!” declared the former and possibly future president. For those offended by the language, these are Trump’s own words, and I think I owe it to my readers to report what he actually said, not sanitize it. Trump also promised to provide “MUCH BETTER HEALTHCARE” without offering any specifics. So let’s discuss substance here. Does Obamacare, in fact, suck? And can we believe Trump’s promise to offer something much better? On the latter question, remember that Trump and his allies came very close to killing the A.C.A. in 2017 and replacing it with their own plan — and the Congressional Budget Office did a detailed analysis of the legislation that almost passed. The budget office predicted that by 2026, the Republican bill would cause 32 million people to lose health insurance, and that the premiums paid by individuals buying their own insurance (as opposed to getting it through their employers) would double. There is, as far as I can tell, no reason to believe that Trump has come up with a better plan since then, or that a new analysis of his plan would be any less dismal. But while ending Obamacare would have ugly results, how well has the A.C.A. actually worked? The main point in Obamacare’s favor is simply the fact that the number of uninsured Americans fell sharply after the law went into effect. We’re still well short of the more or less universal coverage provided by every other advanced country, and the health insurance some Americans have remains inadequate, but the gap has narrowed a lot. Now, Obamacare’s success hasn’t happened in quite the way its proponents expected. Most of the original discussion of reform focused on creating exchanges where individuals could buy their own insurance. And such “non-group” coverage has indeed expanded, but most of the rise in coverage has instead come from an expansion of Medicaid (which would be even larger if some red states, including Texas and Florida, weren’t still refusing to accept federal dollars to help their own residents). Still, success is success, even if it didn’t happen quite the way you predicted. And I would argue that the insurance exchanges convey major benefits that go beyond the number of people currently using them. Before Obamacare, Americans with preexisting medical conditions who weren’t lucky enough to get coverage through their employers were in dire straits: Insurers either wouldn’t cover them at all or would charge exorbitant premiums. I personally knew some people who stayed in jobs they hated because they had health problems and feared losing insurance. Now insurers are prohibited from discriminating based on medical history; and this, combined with subsidies that keep premiums down, has given Americans some much-needed security. But what about the costs? Was Obamacare a fiscal disaster? Calculating the true costs of the A.C.A. is tricky, in part because the law, while offering extensive subsidies, also included many measures aimed at reducing health costs. What I find striking is that federal spending on health care since the A.C.A. was passed has grown much more slowly than almost anyone expected. For example, in its 2010 report on the long-term budget outlook, the budget office projected that spending on major health programs in 2023 would come in between 7.4 percent and 7.9 percent of gross domestic product. It now expects that number to be only 5.8 percent. Predictions that Obamacare would lead to runaway spending have proved completely wrong. Why, then, is Trump still determined to kill a program that has improved many lives without busting the budget? Much of it, no doubt, reflects the general hostility of the modern Republican Party to any program that helps less fortunate Americans. But it’s hard to escape the sense that there’s also something personal involved. In his rambling speeches, Trump often seems to believe that Barack Obama is still the president. Regardless of whether Trump is actually confused about this, the Affordable Care Act was Obama’s biggest achievement. And everyone still calls the program Obamacare. Is Trump vain and petty enough that he would take health care away from millions simply to demolish his predecessor’s legacy? You tell me.",D
"The lights are going to stay on in federal government offices, and also in the suite of the House speaker, Mike Johnson, at least for a few more weeks. Up to now, it hadn’t been clear that both could happen at the same time. Mr. Johnson, who has been in his job only since Oct. 25, had to scramble to prevent the government from shutting down this Friday, and he managed to pull it off. He came up with an oddly structured stopgap bill to keep the government open until early next year, which the House passed on Tuesday and the Senate late Wednesday. President Biden has agreed to sign it before the deadline. Thus for a moment there was a feeling of bipartisan warmth on the House side of the Capitol. But it’s almost certainly a false spring, because within a day, Republicans were fighting one another over extremist demands, the far right was raging about the swamp and failure theater, and veiled threats were made that Mr. Johnson had better get with the spending-cut program fast. In this House, every tiny step forward is immediately followed by bigger steps in the other direction. If nothing else, Mr. Johnson performed the most basic function of his job. It’s hard to praise him for that, but until Tuesday, it wasn’t at all clear that Mr. Johnson had the inner strength or legislative savvy to make it happen. This is the same guy who has devoted most of his political bandwidth to preventing all abortions, “cross-dressing” and same-sex marriage, and a few days ago, he refused to allow Israel to get any military aid unless it was accompanied by a cut to the Internal Revenue Service. When it came to keeping the government open, would he have the guts to be reasonable? The last speaker who prevented a shutdown, Kevin McCarthy, was booted from his position by Republican extremists for working with Democrats to pass a stopgap bill. Mr. Johnson might have tried to appease the howling kennel on the far right by throwing it a treat in exchange for support, as he did with the I.R.S. enforcement money. But on this bill, he didn’t. There were no policy riders or crazy demands for cuts, and as a result, all but two House Democrats voted for it. Republicans, on the other hand, split into their usual camps. Most of the caucus — the 127 members who are, for convenience’s sake, called centrists, though few of them really are — voted for the bill, but 93 said no. Many of them said they oppose the idea of stopgap bills on principle, and they don’t care what damage a shutdown would do to the economy or the country’s reputation. Any of those 93 could call for Mr. Johnson’s ouster, but that’s not going to happen this round. The calculation seems to be that the new speaker is still in some kind of honeymoon period, that no one wants another embarrassing speaker fight or that members want to get home for Thanksgiving without a shutdown hanging over their heads. The far right never trusted Mr. McCarthy, but feels a kinship with Mr. Johnson’s fringe cultural positions. But underlying it all is the desire for some running room for the big spending fight to come this winter. The stopgap bill is weird because it punts that fight to two dates. On Jan. 19, funding will run out for a group of agencies including those handling transportation, housing, energy, agriculture and veterans’ affairs. On Feb. 2, funding will run out for everything else, including the Pentagon. The danger of that approach is that the far right could create a partial shutdown on Jan. 19 of agencies they don’t care about, which is the kind of bloody trophy many of them would be proud to carry home and wave around. That kind of threat could really become reality, along with a full shutdown on Feb. 2, because the extremists are eager to start demanding their favorite policy provisions in the full-year spending bills for each agency that will be necessary after the stopgap. (Mr. Johnson has said he won’t do any more stopgaps, known as continuing resolutions.) Take the bill that pays for the Agriculture Department and the Food and Drug Administration, for example. The far right has been trying for weeks to insert in it a provision that would prohibit abortion pills from being distributed by mail. That requirement isn’t popular even among Republicans, let alone Democrats, and the House has been unable to pass the bill. The impasse, which is also about overall farm funding levels, will need to be settled to avert an agriculture shutdown. Another example is the bill to pay for the Justice, State and Commerce Departments. The extremists want huge spending cuts there and have demanded to slash the budget for the F.B.I., in servitude to Donald Trump’s vilification of the agency. That isn’t going to happen, but if they insist on it in the post-stopgap negotiations, those three departments might be forced to shut down while adults try to work out a compromise. One sign of the intransigence to come occurred on Wednesday, when right-wingers blocked that bill out of anger at the stopgap bill, joined by Democrats who would never consider those kinds of cuts. These are the kinds of fights many House Republicans really want, and this week’s interim bill just kicks them down the road for a couple of months. Mr. Johnson gets a very temporary positive grade for not creating chaos before the holidays, but the bigger test is coming, and it could kick off a very contentious 2024.",D
